  caveats <<~EOS
    This build needs a CPU with AVX2 (Intel Macs from 2013 on). If ToshLLM quits
    on launch with "illegal hardware instruction", install the other build:
      brew uninstall --cask toshllm
      brew install --cask engeldlgado/tap/toshllm-noavx2

    Downloaded models are left in place; remove them by hand if you no longer
    want them.
